## Description

Implement comprehensive unit tests for JWT authentication, token validation, and authorization mechanisms with complete security scenario coverage.

## Details

- **JWT Authentication Tests**:
  - Token validation and signature verification
  - Token expiration and refresh logic
  - Token claims parsing and validation
  - Invalid token handling and error scenarios
  - Token blacklisting and revocation

- **Keycloak Integration Tests**:
  - Keycloak client configuration and setup
  - User authentication and authorization flows
  - Role-based access control validation
  - Keycloak service integration and error handling
  - Token introspection and user info retrieval

- **Authorization Tests**:
  - Role-based authorization validation
  - Permission checks and access control
  - Authorization policy enforcement
  - Unauthorized access handling
  - Authorization context management

## Test Strategy

- **Coverage Requirements**:
  - **Line Coverage**: 95%+ for all authentication components
  - **Method Coverage**: 100% for all public methods
  - **Security Coverage**: 100% for all security scenarios

- **Mock Strategy**:
  - Mock Keycloak service interactions
  - Mock JWT validation services
  - Mock authorization providers
  - Simulate authentication failure scenarios
  - Mock token generation and validation

- **Success Criteria**:
  - All authentication components have comprehensive unit tests
  - 95%+ code coverage for authentication layer
  - All security scenarios thoroughly tested
  - Authorization logic properly validated
  - Test execution time under 15 seconds
