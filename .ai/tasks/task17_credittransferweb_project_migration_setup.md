## Description

Create new .NET 8 ASP.NET Core Web API project in /Services directory to replace original .NET Framework 4.x CreditTransferWeb

## Details

- Create new ASP.NET Core Web API project structure in `Migrated/src/Services/WebServices/CreditTransferWeb`
- Set up proper project configuration with .NET 8 target framework
- Configure dependency injection and service registration
- Add necessary NuGet packages for HTTP handling, XML processing, and JWT authentication
- Set up project references to existing Core and Infrastructure projects
- Configure logging with Serilog integration matching other services
- Create basic project structure with controllers, services, and configuration
- Add health check endpoints for monitoring
- Configure CORS for USSD gateway integration if needed
- Set up Docker support for containerization

## Test Strategy

- Verify project compiles successfully with all dependencies resolved
- Validate project structure follows established patterns from other services
- Test that basic health check endpoints are accessible
- Confirm Docker build process works correctly
- Verify all required NuGet packages are properly installed and configured
