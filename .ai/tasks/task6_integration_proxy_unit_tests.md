## Description

Implement unit tests for NobillCallsService and all integration proxies with comprehensive mocking and error scenario coverage.

## Details

- **NobillCallsService Tests**:
  - SOAP service client configuration and setup
  - Service method invocation and response handling
  - Error handling and exception mapping
  - Request/response data transformation
  - Service client lifecycle management

- **Integration Proxy Tests**:
  - HTTP client configuration and setup
  - Service endpoint communication
  - Request/response serialization
  - Error handling and retry logic
  - Service authentication and authorization

- **External Service Mock Tests**:
  - Mock external service responses
  - Simulate service unavailability scenarios
  - Test timeout and retry mechanisms
  - Validate error handling and fallback logic
  - Test service circuit breaker patterns

## Test Strategy

- **Coverage Requirements**:
  - **Line Coverage**: 85%+ for all integration proxies
  - **Method Coverage**: 100% for all public methods
  - **Integration Coverage**: 90%+ for external service interactions

- **Mock Strategy**:
  - Mock all external service calls
  - Mock HTTP client operations
  - Mock SOAP service responses
  - Simulate network failures and timeouts
  - Mock authentication and authorization services

- **Success Criteria**:
  - All integration proxies have comprehensive unit tests
  - 85%+ code coverage for integration layer
  - All external service interactions properly mocked
  - Error scenarios thoroughly tested
  - Test execution time under 15 seconds
