## Description

Implement comprehensive integration tests for REST API, WCF Service, and Worker Service with real dependencies and full service interaction validation.

## Details

- **REST API Integration Tests**:
  - Controller endpoint integration testing
  - Request/response validation with real data
  - Authentication and authorization integration
  - Error handling and exception scenarios
  - API versioning and backward compatibility

- **WCF Service Integration Tests**:
  - SOAP service endpoint integration testing
  - Service contract validation and compliance
  - Authentication and authorization integration
  - Error handling and fault exception scenarios
  - Service binding and configuration testing

- **Worker Service Integration Tests**:
  - Background service startup and lifecycle
  - Service dependency injection validation
  - Configuration and environment integration
  - Service health checks and monitoring
  - Error handling and recovery scenarios

## Test Strategy

- **Coverage Requirements**:
  - **Integration Coverage**: 90%+ for all service interactions
  - **Endpoint Coverage**: 100% for all API endpoints
  - **Service Coverage**: 100% for all service contracts

- **Infrastructure Requirements**:
  - Use TestContainers for real database testing
  - Use TestContainers for Redis integration testing
  - Mock external services (NoBill, Keycloak) appropriately
  - Use real HTTP client integrations where possible

- **Success Criteria**:
  - All services have comprehensive integration tests
  - 90%+ integration coverage for service layer
  - All service contracts properly validated
  - Real dependency interactions tested
  - Test execution time under 5 minutes
