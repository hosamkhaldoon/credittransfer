## Description

Implement comprehensive security testing including authentication, authorization, and vulnerability scanning with complete security scenario coverage.

## Details

- **Authentication Security Tests**:
  - JWT token security and validation testing
  - Token expiration and refresh security
  - Authentication bypass and injection testing
  - Multi-factor authentication security validation
  - Session management security testing

- **Authorization Security Tests**:
  - Role-based access control security testing
  - Permission escalation and bypass testing
  - Authorization context security validation
