## Description

Implement comprehensive unit tests for the database-driven Transfer Rules system that controls credit transfer business logic based on subscription types, country rules, and configurable restrictions.

## Details

### **Transfer Rules System Components**:

1. **`ITransferRulesService.EvaluateTransferRuleAsync()`**:
   - Database-driven business rule evaluation
   - Country-specific rule processing (OM vs KSA)
   - Subscription type combination validation
   - Priority-based rule evaluation
   - Wildcard rule support (* destinations)
   - Rule caching and performance validation

2. **Rule Configuration Testing**:
   - Configuration-dependent rule evaluation
   - Dynamic rule modification scenarios
   - Rule precedence and conflict resolution
   - Default behavior when no rules exist
   - Error code mapping (ErrorCode 33 for restrictions)

### **Test Scenarios by Country**:

**Oman (OM) Business Rules**:
- Customer -> Pos: DENIED (ErrorCode 33)
- Customer -> Customer: ALLOWED
- Customer -> Distributor: ALLOWED
- Pos -> Customer: ALLOWED
- DataAccount -> *: DENIED (wildcard rule)
- HalafoniCustomer -> Customer: ALLOWED

**Saudi Arabia (KSA) Business Rules**:
- VirginPrepaid -> Pos: DENIED (ErrorCode 33)
- Customer -> VirginPrepaid: ALLOWED
- VirginPrepaid -> VirginPrepaid: ALLOWED
- Customer -> Customer: ALLOWED

**Cross-Country Scenarios**:
- Rules from different countries not interfering
- Default behavior for undefined country rules
- Fallback to global rules when country-specific rules missing

### **Wildcard Rule Testing**:
- DataAccount -> ANY_SUBSCRIPTION_TYPE: DENIED
- Wildcard destination matching (* destination)
- Wildcard source matching (if supported)
- Priority of wildcard vs specific rules

### **Configuration-Dependent Rules**:
- Rules requiring additional configuration values
- Business rules that depend on TransferConfig settings
- Rules with amount thresholds and limits
- Time-based or date-based rule validation
- Customer segment-specific rules

### **Rule Priority and Conflict Resolution**:
- Multiple applicable rules with different priorities
- Highest priority rule wins scenario testing
- Tie-breaking mechanisms
- Rule ordering and precedence validation
- Conflicting rule resolution strategies

### **Performance and Caching Tests**:
- Rule caching effectiveness validation
- Database vs cached rule retrieval performance
- Cache invalidation scenarios
- Rule modification impact on cache
- Bulk rule evaluation performance

### **Error Handling and Edge Cases**:
- Invalid subscription type combinations
- Database unavailability scenarios
- Malformed rule configurations
- Missing rule data scenarios
- Rule evaluation timeout handling

### **Mock Strategy**:
- Mock `ITransferRulesService` for different rule scenarios
- Mock database repository for rule retrieval
- Mock Redis cache for rule caching scenarios
- Mock configuration services for rule-dependent settings
- Create comprehensive test data sets for all rule combinations

### **Integration with CreditTransferService**:
- Rule evaluation integration in transfer validation
- Error code propagation from rules to transfer response
- Rule evaluation timing and performance impact
- Rule-based transfer denial scenarios
- Audit logging for rule-based decisions

## Success Criteria

- All Transfer Rules system components have comprehensive unit tests
- 100% coverage of rule evaluation logic
- All country-specific rule scenarios tested (20+ combinations)
- All wildcard rule scenarios validated
- Configuration-dependent rules fully tested
- Rule priority and conflict resolution validated
- Performance and caching effectiveness proven
- Error handling for all edge cases implemented
- Integration with CreditTransferService validated
- Test execution time under 20 seconds
