## Description

Implement unit tests for ErrorConfigurationService, TransferRulesService, and other supporting application services with complete functionality coverage.

## Details

- **ErrorConfigurationService Tests**:
  - Error message retrieval and caching
  - Language-specific error message handling
  - Configuration fallback logic
  - Error code mapping validation
  - Message template formatting tests

- **TransferRulesService Tests**:
  - Transfer rule validation logic
  - Business rule configuration processing
  - Transfer limit calculation
  - Subscription type compatibility validation
  - Rule caching and performance optimization

- **Supporting Service Tests**:
  - Service initialization and dependency injection
  - Configuration service integration
  - Logging and telemetry integration
  - Service lifecycle management
  - Error handling and recovery

## Test Strategy

- **Coverage Requirements**:
  - **Line Coverage**: 90%+ for all supporting services
  - **Method Coverage**: 100% for all public methods
  - **Integration Coverage**: 85%+ for service dependencies

- **Success Criteria**:
  - All supporting services have comprehensive unit tests
  - 90%+ code coverage for supporting services
  - All service dependencies properly mocked
  - Test execution time under 15 seconds
