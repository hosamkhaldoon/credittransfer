## Description

Implement comprehensive unit tests for internal business logic helper methods in CreditTransferService that handle core transfer execution, network validation, and business rule processing.

## Details

### **Core Internal Methods to Test**:

1. **`TransferCreditInternalAsync()`**:
   - Core internal transfer execution logic
   - Transaction orchestration and workflow
   - Error handling and rollback scenarios
   - OpenTelemetry integration and activity tracking
   - Transaction state management
   - Success and failure response mapping

2. **`CheckBothOnSameINAsync()`**:
   - Subscription network validation (same IN network)
   - Dealer flag detection and processing
   - SubscriptionTypes configuration parsing
   - Network compatibility checking
   - Configuration-based network rules
   - Cross-network transfer restrictions

3. **`GetDaysToExtend()`**:
   - Subscription extension logic
   - Semicolon-separated configuration parsing
   - Subscription type to extension days mapping
   - Configuration value validation
   - Default extension behavior
   - Extension calculation algorithms

4. **`GetRelatedTransferReason()`**:
   - Transfer reason assignment logic
   - Subscription type-based reason mapping
   - IN network status influence on reasons
   - Business rule-driven reason selection
   - Configuration-based reason customization
   - Fallback reason handling

### **NoBill Integration Helper Methods**:

1. **`ReserveEventAsync()`**:
   - Amount reservation on source account
   - Reservation code generation and tracking
   - Reservation timeout handling
   - Failure scenarios and error mapping
   - Reservation rollback mechanisms

2. **`CommitEventAsync()`**:
   - Reserved amount commitment
   - Final transfer execution
   - Transaction finalization
   - Success confirmation handling
   - Commitment failure recovery

3. **`CancelEventAsync()`**:
   - Reservation cancellation logic
   - Rollback transaction handling
   - Cleanup operations
   - Error state recovery
   - Audit trail for cancellations

4. **`TransferFundAsync()`**:
   - Direct fund transfer execution
   - Amount transfer validation
   - Transfer confirmation
   - Error handling and recovery
   - Transaction logging

5. **`ExtendDaysAsync()`**:
   - Subscription extension execution
   - Extension validation
   - Days calculation and application
   - Extension failure handling
   - Extension audit logging

6. **`SendSMSAsync()`**:
   - SMS notification sending
   - Message template processing
   - Bilingual message handling
   - SMS delivery confirmation
   - Failure tolerance and logging

### **Configuration and Mapping Methods**:

1. **`GetRelatedAdjustmentReasonOldToNew()`**:
   - Adjustment reason mapping (legacy to new)
   - Configuration-based mapping
   - Mapping validation and fallbacks
   - Version compatibility handling

2. **`GetRelatedAdjustmentReasonNewToOld()`**:
   - Reverse adjustment reason mapping
   - Backward compatibility support
   - Mapping consistency validation
   - Error handling for unmapped reasons

### **Test Scenarios for Each Method**:

**Success Path Testing**:
- Normal execution flows for all methods
- Configuration-based behavior validation
- Integration between helper methods
- Performance under normal load

**Error Handling Testing**:
- NoBill service failures
- Configuration missing or invalid
- Network connectivity issues
- Database transaction failures
- SMS service unavailability

**Edge Cases Testing**:
- Concurrent execution scenarios
- Resource exhaustion scenarios
- Timeout handling
- Partial failure recovery
- Data consistency validation

**Configuration Testing**:
- Various configuration combinations
- Missing configuration handling
- Invalid configuration values
- Configuration cache scenarios
- Configuration update impacts

### **Mock Strategy**:
- Mock `INobillCallsService` for all NoBill operations
- Mock `IConfiguration` for configuration-based methods
- Mock `ILogger` for audit and error logging
- Mock database repositories for data operations
- Mock SMS service for notification testing
- Create realistic business scenario test data

### **Integration Testing**:
- Helper method interaction validation
- Workflow orchestration testing
- Error propagation between methods
- Transaction boundary testing
- Resource cleanup validation

### **Performance Testing**:
- Method execution time measurement
- Resource utilization monitoring
- Concurrent execution performance
- Cache effectiveness validation
- Database query optimization

## Success Criteria

- All internal business logic helper methods have comprehensive unit tests
- 100% method coverage for helper methods
- 95%+ branch coverage for all conditional logic
- All error scenarios and edge cases covered
- NoBill integration fully mocked and tested
- Configuration-dependent behavior validated
- Performance benchmarks established
- Mock interactions properly verified
- Transaction orchestration validated
- Test execution time under 20 seconds
