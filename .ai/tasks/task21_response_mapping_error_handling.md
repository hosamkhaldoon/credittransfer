## Description

Implement response mapping from REST API responses to original XML format with identical error code mapping

## Details

- Map REST API response codes to original XML response codes
- Generate XML responses using exact same template as original system
- Implement error code translation between REST API and XML responses
- Handle successful transfer responses with proper status codes
- Map business logic errors to appropriate XML error responses
- Implement fallback error responses for API communication failures
- Maintain exact same response timing characteristics as original
- Preserve original response structure and formatting
- Handle partial failures and mixed response scenarios
- Implement comprehensive error logging while maintaining response format

## Test Strategy

- Test response mapping for all success scenarios
- Verify error code translation matches original system exactly
- Test XML response format matches original templates
- Validate error scenarios generate correct XML error responses
- Test fallback responses for API failures
- Compare response timing with original system
- Test with various error conditions from the API
- Verify response logging doesn't affect response format
