## Description

**PARENT TASK - BROKEN DOWN INTO SUB-TASKS**

Implement comprehensive unit tests for the main CreditTransferService (1751 lines) focusing on core business logic methods with complete scenario coverage.

**This task has been broken down into 5 focused sub-tasks for better management and parallel execution:**

- **Task 3.1.1**: Core Transfer Methods Unit Tests (TransferCreditAsync, etc.)
- **Task 3.1.2**: Transfer Rules System Unit Tests (Database-driven business logic)
- **Task 3.1.3**: Input Validation System Unit Tests (ValidateTransferInputsInternalAsync)
- **Task 3.1.4**: Business Logic Helper Methods Unit Tests (Internal methods)
- **Task 3.1.5**: Configuration and Utility Methods Unit Tests (PIN, amounts, mappings)

## Details

- **Core Transfer Methods Tests**:
  - `TransferCreditAsync()`: Complete transfer workflow validation
  - `TransferCreditWithAdjustmentReasonAsync()`: Adjustment reason processing
  - `TransferCreditWithoutPinforSCAsync()`: Customer service transfer logic
  - `ValidateTransferInputsAsync()`: Input validation without transfer execution
  - `GetDenominationAsync()`: Denomination configuration retrieval

- **Business Logic Helper Methods Tests**:
  - `TransferCreditInternalAsync()`: Core internal transfer logic
  - `ValidateTransferInputsInternalAsync()`: Internal validation logic
  - `CheckBothOnSameINAsync()`: Subscription network validation
  - `GetDaysToExtend()`: Subscription extension logic
  - `GetRelatedTransferReason()`: Transfer reason assignment logic

- **Transfer Rules System Tests (Database-Driven Business Logic)**:
  - Configurable business rules validation using `_transferRulesService.EvaluateTransferRuleAsync()`
  - Country-specific rule evaluation (OM vs KSA business rules)
  - Subscription type combination validation (Customer, Pos, Distributor, HalafoniCustomer, etc.)
  - Wildcard rule testing (DataAccount -> * restrictions)
  - Priority-based rule evaluation and conflict resolution
  - Rule caching and performance validation
  - Configuration-dependent rule evaluation
  - Error code mapping from transfer rules (ErrorCode 33 for restrictions)
  - Transfer rule fallback behavior (default allow when no rules found)

- **ValidateTransferInputsInternalAsync Complete Coverage**:
  - Parameter validation (MSISDN length, format, source != destination)
  - NoBill subscription type retrieval and error handling
  - Transfer config validation and subscription type mapping
  - **CONFIGURABLE BUSINESS RULES** (Transfer Rules system integration)
  - Balance percentage validation (MaximumPercentageAmount)
  - Subscription block status validation
  - Subscription status validation (ACTIVE_BEFORE_FIRST_USE handling)
  - Maximum transfer amount validation by service name
  - Minimum transfer amount validation from config
  - Daily transfer count limit validation
  - Daily transfer cap limit validation
  - Post-transfer balance validation (MinPostTransferBalance)

- **Configuration and Utility Tests**:
  - `GetAccountPinByServiceNameAsync()`: PIN retrieval and validation
  - `GetAccountMaxTransferAmountByServiceNameAsync()`: Maximum amount validation
  - `GetRelatedAdjustmentReasonOldToNew()`: Adjustment reason mapping
  - `GetRelatedAdjustmentReasonNewToOld()`: Reverse adjustment mapping
  - Configuration value processing and caching

## Test Strategy

- **Coverage Requirements**:
  - **Line Coverage**: 98%+ for core business logic methods
  - **Branch Coverage**: 95%+ for all conditional logic
  - **Method Coverage**: 100% for all public methods
  - **Scenario Coverage**: All business scenarios covered
  - **Transfer Rules Coverage**: 100% for all rule combinations

- **Transfer Rules Test Scenarios**:
  - **Oman Rules**: Customer->Pos (denied), Customer->Customer (allowed), DataAccount->* (denied)
  - **KSA Rules**: VirginPrepaid->Pos (denied), Customer->VirginPrepaid (allowed)
  - **Wildcard Rules**: DataAccount cannot transfer to anyone
  - **Configuration Rules**: Rules requiring configuration values
  - **Priority Testing**: Multiple rules with different priorities
  - **Country Fallback**: Default behavior when no country-specific rules exist
  - **Rule Caching**: Performance with cached vs. database lookups

- **Mock Strategy**:
  - Mock all external dependencies (NoBill, Database, Redis)
  - Mock `ITransferRulesService.EvaluateTransferRuleAsync()` for rule scenarios
  - Mock configuration services and repositories
  - Mock authentication and authorization services
  - Maintain realistic business data scenarios

- **Success Criteria**:
  - All core business logic methods have comprehensive unit tests
  - 98%+ code coverage for CreditTransferService core logic
  - All business scenarios thoroughly tested
  - All Transfer Rules combinations validated (20+ rule scenarios)
  - Performance validated (tests under 30 seconds)
  - OpenTelemetry metrics properly tested
