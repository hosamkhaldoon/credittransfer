## Test Strategy

- **Coverage Validation Process**:
  1. Execute all unit tests with coverage collection
  2. Execute integration tests with coverage collection
  3. Aggregate coverage data across all test projects
  4. Validate coverage thresholds for each project
  5. Generate comprehensive coverage reports
  6. Analyze coverage gaps and provide recommendations
  7. Validate quality gate compliance

- **Coverage Target Validation**:
  - **Overall Solution Coverage**: 95%+ line coverage
  - **Critical Business Logic**: 98%+ line coverage (CreditTransferService)
  - **Exception Handling**: 100% coverage (all 24+ exception types)
  - **Public API Coverage**: 100% method coverage
  - **Integration Points**: 95%+ coverage

- **Performance Requirements**:
  - Coverage collection should not increase test execution time by more than 50%
  - Coverage report generation under 30 seconds
  - HTML report loading under 5 seconds
  - Coverage analysis completion under 2 minutes

- **Quality Metrics**:
  - Line coverage: 95%+ across all projects
  - Branch coverage: 90%+ for business logic
  - Method coverage: 98%+ for public methods
  - Coverage report accuracy: 100%
  - Quality gate reliability: 100%

- **Success Criteria**:

  - Comprehensive HTML coverage reports generated
  - Coverage quality gates integrated into CI/CD
  - Coverage gap analysis providing actionable recommendations
  - Performance impact of coverage collection minimized
