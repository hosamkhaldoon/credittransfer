## Description

Implement integration tests for NoBill, Keycloak, Database, and Redis with real service interactions and comprehensive error scenario coverage.

## Details

- **NoBill Integration Tests**:
  - SOAP service integration and communication
  - Service method invocation with real data
  - Error handling and exception mapping
  - Service authentication and authorization
  - Performance and timeout testing

- **Keycloak Integration Tests**:
  - JWT token generation and validation
  - User authentication and authorization flows
  - Role-based access control validation
  - Token refresh and expiration handling
  - Service configuration and setup

- **Database Integration Tests**:
  - Entity Framework Core integration
  - Database connection and transaction management
  - Repository pattern implementation testing
  - Database migration and schema validation
  - Performance and connection pooling

- **Redis Integration Tests**:
  - Cache provider integration and operations
  - Cache key management and expiration
  - Cache consistency and performance
  - Redis connection and failover testing
  - Cache invalidation and refresh scenarios

## Test Strategy

- **Coverage Requirements**:
  - **Integration Coverage**: 95%+ for all external dependencies
  - **Service Coverage**: 100% for all external service interactions
  - **Error Coverage**: 90%+ for all error scenarios

- **Infrastructure Requirements**:
  - Use TestContainers for database testing
  - Use TestContainers for Redis testing
  - Mock NoBill and Keycloak services appropriately
  - Use real service configurations where possible

- **Success Criteria**:
  - All external dependencies have comprehensive integration tests
  - 95%+ integration coverage for external services
  - All error scenarios thoroughly tested
  - Service reliability and performance validated
  - Test execution time under 8 minutes
