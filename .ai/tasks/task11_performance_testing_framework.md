## Description

Set up NBomber performance testing framework with load testing scenarios and benchmarking against the original .NET Framework 4.0 system.

## Details

- **NBomber Framework Setup**:
  - NBomber test project configuration
  - Load testing scenario configuration
  - Performance metrics collection and reporting
  - Benchmark testing against baseline performance
  - Stress testing and scalability validation

- **Performance Test Scenarios**:
  - Credit transfer operation load testing
  - Concurrent user simulation and testing
  - Database and Redis performance testing
  - API endpoint performance benchmarking
  - Service scalability and capacity testing

- **Performance Monitoring**:
  - Application performance monitoring integration
  - Resource utilization tracking and analysis
  - Performance bottleneck identification
  - Performance regression detection
  - Performance reporting and visualization

## Test Strategy

- **Performance Requirements**:
  - **Throughput**: Match or exceed original system performance
  - **Response Time**: 95th percentile under 2 seconds
  - **Concurrent Users**: Support 100+ concurrent users
  - **Resource Utilization**: CPU under 80%, Memory under 4GB

- **Infrastructure Requirements**:
  - Use performance testing environment
  - Use realistic data sets and scenarios
  - Use production-like configuration
  - Use monitoring and profiling tools

- **Success Criteria**:
  - Performance testing framework fully configured
  - All performance scenarios implemented
  - Baseline performance benchmarks established
  - Performance regression detection enabled
  - Performance reporting automated
