# PRD: Credit Transfer System - Testing Framework & Legacy Component Migration

## 1. Product overview

### 1.1 Document title and version

- PRD: Credit Transfer System - Testing Framework & Legacy Component Migration
- Version: 1.1

### 1.2 Product summary

This plan outlines the comprehensive strategy for both testing framework implementation and legacy component migration for the Credit Transfer system (.NET Framework 4.0 â†’ .NET 8). The plan encompasses achieving full code coverage across all layers while migrating remaining legacy components to modern .NET 8 architecture. This includes the critical CreditTransferWeb migration from .NET Framework 4.x to .NET 8 with REST API integration.

## 2. Project scope and objectives

### 2.1 Core objectives

- **Full Code Coverage**: Achieve 95%+ code coverage across all projects
- **Behavioral Compatibility**: Ensure 100% compatibility with original .NET Framework 4.0 system
- **Legacy Component Migration**: Complete migration of remaining .NET Framework 4.x components
- **Performance Validation**: Validate performance meets or exceeds original system benchmarks
- **Security Testing**: Comprehensive security testing including JWT authentication and authorization
- **Integration Testing**: Full integration testing with external services (NoBill, Keycloak, Database, Redis)

### 2.2 Project components

- **Testing Framework**: Comprehensive unit, integration, and performance testing
- **Legacy Migration**: CreditTransferWeb migration to .NET 8 with REST API integration
- **Service Modernization**: Replace WCF integration with modern REST API calls
- **Security Enhancement**: JWT authentication and modern authorization patterns

## 3. Feature-specific plans

### 3.1 Testing framework plans

- **[Integration Testing Framework](features/integration-testing-plan.md)**: Service integration and external dependency testing
- **[Performance Testing Framework](features/performance-testing-plan.md)**: Load testing and performance benchmarking
- **[Security Testing Framework](features/security-testing-plan.md)**: Authentication, authorization, and security validation

### 3.2 Migration plans

- **[CreditTransferWeb Migration](features/credittransferweb-migration-plan.md)**: Migration from .NET Framework 4.x to .NET 8 with REST API integration

### 3.3 Infrastructure components

- **Test Project Structure**: Organized test projects mirroring production architecture
- **Test Data Management**: Automated test data setup and teardown
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated testing pipeline with coverage reporting
- **Test Reporting**: Comprehensive test results and coverage reporting
- **Containerization**: Docker support for migrated components
- **Configuration Management**: Modern configuration patterns for all services

## 4. Success criteria

### 4.1 Testing coverage targets

- **Code Coverage**: 95%+ across all projects
- **Branch Coverage**: 90%+ for critical business logic
- **Integration Coverage**: 100% of external service interactions
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Meet or exceed original system performance

### 4.2 Migration targets

- **100% Functional Compatibility**: All migrated components maintain exact same behavior
- **Zero Integration Changes**: External systems require no modifications
- **Performance Improvement**: Target 20% performance improvement for migrated components
- **Security Enhancement**: Modern JWT authentication and authorization

### 4.3 Quality gates

- All tests must pass before deployment
- Code coverage thresholds must be met
- Performance benchmarks must be achieved
- Security tests must pass with no critical vulnerabilities
- Migration components must pass backward compatibility tests
