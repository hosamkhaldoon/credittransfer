# PRD: Credit Transfer System - Comprehensive Testing Framework

## 1. Product overview

### 1.1 Document title and version

- PRD: Credit Transfer System - Comprehensive Testing Framework
- Version: 1.0

### 1.2 Product summary

This plan outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the migrated Credit Transfer system (.NET Framework 4.0 â†’ .NET 8), focusing on achieving full code coverage across all layers including unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing. The testing framework will ensure behavioral compatibility with the original system while validating all new .NET 8 features and integrations.

## 2. Project scope and testing coverage

### 2.1 Core testing objectives

- **Full Code Coverage**: Achieve 95%+ code coverage across all projects
- **Behavioral Compatibility**: Ensure 100% compatibility with original .NET Framework 4.0 system
- **Performance Validation**: Validate performance meets or exceeds original system benchmarks
- **Security Testing**: Comprehensive security testing including JWT authentication and authorization
- **Integration Testing**: Full integration testing with external services (NoBill, Keycloak, Database, Redis)

### 2.2 Testing layers

- **Unit Testing**: Individual component testing with mocking
- **Integration Testing**: Service-to-service interaction testing
- **End-to-End Testing**: Complete workflow testing
- **Performance Testing**: Load testing and benchmarking
- **Security Testing**: Authentication, authorization, and vulnerability testing
