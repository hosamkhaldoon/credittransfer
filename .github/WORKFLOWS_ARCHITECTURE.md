# GitHub Actions Workflow Architecture - Modular & Scalable

*Generated by Cursor AI Assistant*

This document outlines the refactored GitHub Actions workflow architecture that implements best practices for maintainability, reusability, and scalability.

## 🎯 Problems Solved

### Before (Original Issues)
- ❌ **400+ line monolithic workflow** doing everything in one place
- ❌ **Identical steps repeated** across WCF, REST API, and Worker services
- ❌ **Copy-paste logic** between repositories
- ❌ **Difficult to maintain** - changes require updating multiple places
- ❌ **Hard to scale** - adding new services requires duplicating entire sections
- ❌ **No reusability** - common patterns reimplemented everywhere

### After (Implemented Solutions)
- ✅ **Modular design** with focused, single-responsibility components
- ✅ **Matrix strategy** for identical service operations
- ✅ **Shared workflows** for common patterns
- ✅ **Composite actions** for reusable steps
- ✅ **Single source of truth** - update once, apply everywhere
- ✅ **Easy to scale** - add new services with minimal configuration
- ✅ **Cross-repository reuse** - share components between projects

  with:
    service-name: 'api'
    dockerfile-path: 'src/Api/Dockerfile'
    image-name: 'myapp-api'
    push-image: true
```

## 🔄 Matrix Strategy Implementation

### Service Configuration Matrix

The matrix strategy eliminates duplicate code by defining service configurations once:

```json
{
  "api": {
    "name": "api",
    "display_name": "REST API",
    "dockerfile": "src/Services/RestApi/CreditTransfer.Services.RestApi/Dockerfile",
    "image": "credittransfer-api",
    "port": 8080,
    "health_path": "/health"
  },
  "wcf": {
    "name": "wcf", 
    "display_name": "WCF Service",
    "dockerfile": "src/Services/WebServices/CreditTransferService/Dockerfile",
    "image": "credittransfer-wcf",
    "port": 80,
    "health_path": "/health"
  }
  // ... additional services
}
```

### Matrix Execution Benefits

**Before**: 3 identical jobs × 20 lines each = 60 lines of duplicate code
```yaml
# Repeated 3 times with minor variations
build-wcf:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - name: Setup Docker
      uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v3
    - name: Build WCF
      run: docker build -f src/Services/WebServices/... 
    # ... 15+ more lines

build-api:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest  
  steps:
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - name: Setup Docker
      uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v3
    - name: Build API
      run: docker build -f src/Services/RestApi/...
    # ... 15+ more lines (nearly identical)

# ... build-worker with same pattern
```

**After**: 1 matrix job = 10 lines total
```yaml
build-services:
  strategy:
    matrix:
      include: ${{ fromJSON(needs.prepare-matrix.outputs.matrix).include }}
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - uses: ./.github/actions/matrix-service-build
      with:
        service-name: ${{ matrix.name }}
        dockerfile-path: ${{ matrix.dockerfile }}
        image-name: ${{ matrix.image }}
```

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Adding a New Service

**Before** (40+ lines of duplication):
```yaml
build-new-service:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - name: Setup Docker Buildx
      uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v3
    - name: Login to Registry
      uses: docker/login-action@v3
      # ... 15+ more duplicate lines
```

**After** (5 lines of configuration):
```json
"gateway": {
  "name": "gateway",
  "display_name": "API Gateway", 
  "dockerfile": "src/Gateway/Dockerfile",
  "image": "credittransfer-gateway",
  "port": 8080
}
```

### Example 2: Multi-Environment Deployment

```yaml
deploy-staging:
  uses: ./.github/workflows/shared-service-matrix.yml
  with:
    operation: 'deploy'
    environment: 'staging'
    services: '["api", "wcf", "worker"]'

deploy-production:
  uses: ./.github/workflows/shared-service-matrix.yml  
  with:
    operation: 'deploy'
    environment: 'production'
    services: '["api", "wcf", "worker", "web"]'
```

### Example 3: Cross-Repository Reuse

**Repository A** (Credit Transfer):
```yaml
quality-check:
  uses: ./.github/workflows/shared-sonarqube-analysis.yml
  with:
    project-key: 'credit-transfer'
    project-name: 'Credit Transfer'
```

**Repository B** (User Management):
```yaml
quality-check:
  uses: orgname/shared-workflows/.github/workflows/shared-sonarqube-analysis.yml@main
  with:
    project-key: 'user-management'  
    project-name: 'User Management'
```
