## 🛠️ SonarCloud Setup

### 1. Create SonarCloud Project
1. Go to [SonarCloud.io](https://sonarcloud.io)
2. Sign in with GitHub account
3. Import your repository
4. Project Key: `credittransfer-modern`
5. Organization: `virgin-group` (or your org)

### 2. Configure SonarCloud Settings
```yaml
# Project Settings → General Settings
Project Name: CreditTransfer.Modern
Project Key: credittransfer-modern
Organization: virgin-group

# Project Settings → Quality Gates
Quality Gate: Sonar way (default)
Custom Conditions:
- Coverage: > 80%
- Duplicated Lines Density: < 3%
- Maintainability Rating: ≤ A
- Reliability Rating: ≤ A
- Security Rating: ≤ A
```

### 3. Generate SonarCloud Token
```bash
# SonarCloud → My Account → Security
Generate Token: GitHub-CI-CreditTransfer
Copy token and add to GitHub Secrets as SONAR_TOKEN
```

## 🐳 Container Registry Setup

### GitHub Container Registry (Recommended)
```bash
# Automatically configured - uses GITHUB_TOKEN
# Images will be published to:
ghcr.io/[owner]/credittransfer-api:latest
ghcr.io/[owner]/credittransfer-wcf:latest  
ghcr.io/[owner]/credittransfer-worker:latest
ghcr.io/[owner]/credittransfer-web:latest
```

### Alternative: Docker Hub
```bash
# Add these secrets if using Docker Hub instead:
DOCKER_USERNAME = "your-docker-username"
DOCKER_PASSWORD = "your-docker-token"
```

## 🧪 Performance Testing Configuration

### K6 Cloud (Optional)
```bash
# For cloud-based load testing, add:
K6_CLOUD_TOKEN = "your-k6-cloud-token"
K6_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID = "your-project-id"
```

### Performance Test Targets
```yaml
# Edit .github/workflows/performance-test.yml
# Update these URLs for your environments:
staging:
  api: "https://staging-api.credittransfer.com"
  wcf: "https://staging-wcf.credittransfer.com"
  web: "https://staging.credittransfer.com"
```

## 🚀 First Deployment Activation

### 1. Trigger Initial CI Pipeline
```bash
# Create a simple change to trigger the pipeline
echo "# CreditTransfer.Modern CI/CD Active" >> .github/README.md
git add .github/README.md
git commit -m "[Cursor] Activate GitHub CI/CD pipeline"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Monitor First Pipeline Run
1. Go to **Actions** tab in GitHub
2. Watch "CI - Build & Test" workflow
3. Verify all jobs complete successfully
4. Check build artifacts and test results

### 3. Validate Security Scanning
1. Go to **Security** tab in GitHub
2. Check **Code scanning alerts**
3. Review **Dependabot alerts**
4. Verify **Secret scanning** is active

### 4. Test Docker Build Pipeline
```bash
# Push to develop branch to trigger Docker builds
git checkout -b develop
git push origin develop
```

## 📊 Monitoring and Validation

### CI/CD Health Dashboard
The README.md includes status badges for all workflows:
- [![CI - Build & Test](https://img.shields.io/badge/CI-Build%20%26%20Test-brightgreen)]()
- [![Docker - Build & Push](https://img.shields.io/badge/Docker-Build%20%26%20Push-blue)]()
- [![Security Scanning](https://img.shields.io/badge/Security-Scanning-orange)]()

### Performance Baselines
| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Build Time | < 10 minutes | Full CI pipeline |
| Test Coverage | > 90% | Unit + Integration tests |
| Security Scan | 0 Critical | High/Critical vulnerabilities |
| Performance | < 2000ms | 95th percentile response time |
| Error Rate | < 5% | Load testing error threshold |

## 🔧 Customization Points

### Service Configuration
Update service matrix in workflows for your specific services:
```yaml
# .github/workflows/docker-build.yml
matrix:
  include:
    - service: api
      dockerfile: src/Services/ApiServices/CreditTransferApi/Dockerfile
    - service: wcf  
      dockerfile: src/Services/WebServices/CreditTransferService/Dockerfile
    # Add/modify services as needed
```

### Environment URLs
Update target URLs in deployment workflows:
```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy-staging.yml
staging_urls:
  api: "https://your-staging-api.com"
  web: "https://your-staging-web.com"
```

### Quality Gates
Customize quality thresholds:
```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci-build-test.yml
env:
  COVERAGE_THRESHOLD: 90  # Adjust coverage requirement
  BUILD_TIMEOUT: 15       # Adjust build timeout
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Build Failures
```bash
# Check these common causes:
- Missing NuGet packages or version conflicts
- .NET SDK version mismatch
- Missing test database connections
- Insufficient runner resources
```

#### 2. Security Scan Failures
```bash
# Common security issues:
- Hardcoded secrets in configuration files
- Vulnerable dependencies
- Missing HTTPS enforcement
- Insecure container base images
```

#### 3. Performance Test Failures
```bash
# Performance issues:
- Target URLs not accessible
- Database connection limits
- Resource constraints in test environment
- Network latency to test targets
```

#### 4. SonarCloud Integration Issues
```bash
# SonarCloud problems:
- Invalid SONAR_TOKEN
- Project key mismatch
- Quality gate failures
- Missing coverage reports
```

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Enable debug logging in workflows
env:
  ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG: true
  ACTIONS_RUNNER_DEBUG: true

# Test workflows locally with act
act -j build --secret-file .secrets
```
