# CreditTransfer.Modern - GitHub CI/CD Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
Enterprise-grade .NET 8 microservices architecture migrated from .NET Framework 4.0, featuring multiple containerized services with comprehensive testing and production deployment capabilities.

## Architecture
- **Core Services**: Domain, Application, Authentication layers
- **Microservices**: WCF Service, REST API, Worker Service, Web Service
- **Infrastructure**: PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Keycloak authentication
- **Testing**: Unit, Integration, Performance, Security test suites
- **Deployment**: Docker Compose, Kubernetes, Istio service mesh, monitoring stack

## Current State
- ✅ Multi-service containerization complete
- ✅ Comprehensive test suites implemented
- ✅ Production deployment infrastructure ready
- ❌ GitHub CI/CD pipeline missing
- ❌ Automated build/test/deploy processes needed

## Goals
1. **Comprehensive CI Pipeline**: Build, test, lint, and security scan all services
2. **Multi-Environment Support**: Development, staging, production workflows
3. **Automated Testing**: Unit, integration, performance, and security testing
4. **Container Management**: Automated Docker builds and registry management
5. **Deployment Automation**: Kubernetes deployment with proper rollback capabilities
6. **Quality Gates**: Code coverage, security scanning, performance benchmarks

## Success Criteria
- All services build and test automatically on every PR
- Automated deployment to staging environment
- Production deployment with approval gates
- 90%+ test coverage maintained
- Security vulnerabilities detected and blocked
- Performance regression detection enabled
