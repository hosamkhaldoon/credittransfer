## Description
Implement automated Docker image building for all microservices with proper tagging, multi-architecture support, and GitHub Container Registry integration.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create Docker build workflow for all services
- [ ] Implement proper image tagging strategy (latest, version, SHA)
- [ ] Configure GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io) integration
- [ ] Set up multi-architecture builds (linux/amd64, linux/arm64)
- [ ] Implement Docker buildx for advanced features
- [ ] Configure image scanning with Trivy
- [ ] Implement build caching for faster builds
- [ ] Create development and production image variants
- [ ] Set up automated cleanup of old images

## Technical Requirements

### Services to Build
- `CreditTransfer.Services.RestApi`
- `CreditTransfer.Services.WcfService` 
- `CreditTransfer.Services.WorkerService`
- `CreditTransfer.Services.WebServices.CreditTransferWeb`

### Docker Build Features
- Multi-stage builds for optimized image sizes
- Layer caching with GitHub Actions cache
- Security scanning integration
- Proper .NET 8 runtime optimization
- Health check integration in images

## Implementation Details

### Image Tagging Strategy
```
ghcr.io/[owner]/credittransfer-api:latest
ghcr.io/[owner]/credittransfer-api:v1.0.0
ghcr.io/[owner]/credittransfer-api:sha-abc1234
ghcr.io/[owner]/credittransfer-api:pr-123
```

### Build Matrix
```yaml
services:
  - name: api
    dockerfile: src/Services/ApiServices/CreditTransferApi/Dockerfile
    context: .
  - name: wcf
    dockerfile: src/Services/WebServices/CreditTransferService/Dockerfile
    context: .
  - name: worker
    dockerfile: src/Services/WorkerServices/CreditTransferWorker/Dockerfile
    context: .
  - name: web
    dockerfile: src/Services/WebServices/CreditTransferWeb/Dockerfile
    context: .
```

### Security & Optimization
- Trivy container scanning
- Distroless base images where possible
- Multi-architecture support
- Build cache optimization
- Image size reporting

## Test Strategy
- Validate all Docker images build successfully
- Confirm images can be pulled from registry
- Test container startup and health checks
- Verify security scanning identifies known vulnerabilities
- Test multi-architecture compatibility

## Integration Points
- Extend main CI workflow from Task 1
- Integrate with existing docker-compose.yml
- Connect to deployment workflows (future tasks)
- Link with monitoring and health check systems

## Files to Create/Modify
- `.github/workflows/docker-build.yml` (new)
- Update existing Dockerfiles for CI optimization
- Create `.dockerignore` optimizations
- Update docker-compose.yml for registry images

## Expected Outcome
Automated Docker image pipeline that builds, scans, and publishes secure, optimized container images for all services within 15 minutes, ready for deployment to any environment.

## Notes
- Consider using GitHub Container Registry vs Docker Hub
- Plan for image vulnerability management
- Optimize build times with proper caching
- Ensure compatibility with existing deployment infrastructure
