## Description
Create the foundational GitHub Actions workflow structure and implement a basic CI pipeline that builds all .NET 8 microservices, runs unit tests, and validates the solution integrity.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create `.github/workflows/` directory structure
- [ ] Implement `ci-build-test.yml` main CI workflow
- [ ] Configure .NET 8 build environment with proper SDK version
- [ ] Build all services: WCF Service, REST API, Worker Service, Web Service
- [ ] Run unit tests with coverage reporting
- [ ] Implement build artifact caching for performance
- [ ] Configure workflow triggers (PR, push to main, manual dispatch)
- [ ] Validate solution builds successfully without errors
- [ ] Generate build status badges for README

## Technical Requirements
- Use official .NET 8 GitHub Actions (`actions/setup-dotnet@v4`)
- Implement matrix strategy for parallel service builds
- Configure MSBuild with proper logging and error handling
- Use `actions/cache@v4` for NuGet package caching
- Implement proper test result reporting with JUnit format
- Configure build artifacts upload for debugging

## Implementation Details

### Workflow Structure
```
.github/workflows/
├── ci-build-test.yml          # Main CI pipeline (this task)
├── security-scan.yml          # Security scanning (future)
├── performance-test.yml       # Performance testing (future)
├── deploy-staging.yml         # Staging deployment (future)
└── deploy-production.yml      # Production deployment (future)
```

### Build Matrix Strategy
- Parallel builds for: RestApi, WcfService, WorkerService, WebService
- Test execution across all test projects
- Artifact generation for each service

### Key Workflow Features
- Automatic PR validation
- Build caching for faster execution
- Comprehensive test reporting
- Build artifact retention
- Proper error handling and notifications

## Test Strategy
- Validate workflow triggers correctly on PR creation/update
- Confirm all services build without errors
- Verify unit tests execute and report results
- Test build artifact generation and storage
- Validate caching mechanisms work correctly

## Files to Create/Modify
- `.github/workflows/ci-build-test.yml` (new)
- Update `README.md` with build status badges
- Validate existing test projects run correctly in CI environment

## Expected Outcome
A robust, fast CI pipeline that automatically validates all code changes, builds all services, runs comprehensive tests, and provides clear feedback to developers within 10 minutes of code push.

## Notes
- Ensure compatibility with existing Docker builds
- Consider build time optimization strategies
- Plan for future integration with security and deployment workflows
- Document workflow configuration for team reference
